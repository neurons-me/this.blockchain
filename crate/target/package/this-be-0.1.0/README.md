# this.be
**this.be** is a foundational crate in the `all.this` ecosystem. It is designed to provide a lightweight, composable identity and state management module that can be embedded into larger systems such as `cleaker`, `neurons.me`, or any Rust-based identity or context-driven runtime.

## 🧠 Purpose
The goal of `this.be` is to encapsulate the concept of a *self-aware object*, allowing it to describe its properties, behaviors, and relationships. This is particularly useful in systems where entities evolve, interact, and maintain complex internal states.

## 📦 Features (planned)
- Lightweight `Be` trait to express identity states.
- Flexible key-value metadata attachment to any entity.
- Runtime state introspection and serialization.

## 🔭 Vision
Part of a broader initiative to unify modular identity, logic, and data expression across environments. `this.be` acts as a kernel from which context, traits, and actions can be layered.
