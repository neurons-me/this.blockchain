# this.blockchain
Part of the **all.this** ecosystem — `this.blockchain` aims to standardize and simplify interaction with blockchain technologies in a decentralized identity framework.

## Purpose
`this.blockchain` is designed to:

- Integrate blockchain logic into the `this.*` semantic model (e.g., `this.me`, `this.have`, `this.do`).
- Serve as the foundation for managing decentralized credentials, signatures, and chains of trust.
- Enable pluggable compatibility with Ethereum, Substrate, and custom protocols.

## Vision
As part of the **Neuroverse** initiative, this crate will eventually power identity verification, on-chain state transitions, and portable cryptographic proofs across web, native, and distributed environments.
